## Run Notebooks on O2 ##

O2 is a platform for Linux-based high performance computing at Harvard Medical School. 
The name is derived from being the next generation of the HMS "Orchestra" cluster, hence "O"2.
O2 is managed by the Research Computing Group, part of HMS IT.

O2 is an HPC cluster built on Linux and the Slurm open source job scheduler.
